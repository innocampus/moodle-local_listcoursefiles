moodle-local_listcoursefiles
============================

This extension allows teachers to view a list of all files in a course and to change the license for each file. It is also possible to download the files in a ZIP archive.

Adding a new license
====================

Since Moodle version `3.9` you can add a custom license via Moodle's [license manager](https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Licences#Licence_manager) in the Site administration.
